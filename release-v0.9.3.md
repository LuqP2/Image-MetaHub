# Release v0.9.3

## üêõ Critical Fixes

### Multiple Folders/Subfolders Selection Bug
- **Fixed**: Images not displaying when multiple folders/subfolders were selected
- **Root Cause**: Overly restrictive filtering logic in `useImageStore.ts` that failed to properly aggregate images from all selected directories
- **Impact**: Users can now select and view images from multiple folders and subfolders simultaneously

### Sidebar Scroll Issue
- **Fixed**: DirectoryList occupying entire sidebar height when many subfolders were expanded
- **Root Cause**: DirectoryList had its own scroll container outside the main sidebar scroll area
- **Solution**: Moved DirectoryList inside the unified sidebar scroll container
- **Impact**: Filters are now always accessible by scrolling, even with many folders/subfolders

## ‚ú® UI Improvements

### Consistent Directory List Design
- DirectoryList now follows the same collapsible design pattern as filter sections
- Added expand/collapse button (matching Models, LoRAs, Schedulers sections)
- Added folder count badge showing number of loaded directories
- Consistent hover states and visual styling

### Better Navigation
- Single unified scrollbar for the entire sidebar
- Improved scrolling behavior between folders and filters
- More intuitive navigation experience
