# Architecture Decisions Log

This file documents significant architectural decisions, design choices, and important conclusions made during development. Each entry represents a completed feature or major change with its rationale and alternatives considered.

## 2025-10-19: [FIX] - ImageTable Virtualization to Prevent Memory Crash

**Decision:**
- Implemented list virtualization using `react-window` and `react-virtualized-auto-sizer`
- Render only visible table rows (~25 at a time) instead of all images simultaneously
- Refactored `ImageTableRow` from `<tr>` to `<div>` with flexbox layout for compatibility with virtualization
- Fixed header with matching column widths
- Overscan of 5 rows for smooth scrolling

**Context:**
When opening ImageTable with 20k+ images and "show all" pagination, the app would crash with `RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed`. The issue occurred because:
1. All 20,000+ table rows rendered simultaneously
2. Each row's `ImageTableRow` component called `fileHandle.getFile()` on mount
3. 20k+ simultaneous Electron IPC `read-file` calls overwhelmed memory allocation
4. Electron process couldn't allocate buffers for all files at once

**Rationale:**
- **Virtualization**: Only render rows currently visible in viewport (~20) + overscan (5 above/below)
- **Memory Control**: Instead of 20k file loads, only ~30 active at any time
- **Scalability**: Works with any number of images without memory issues
- **Performance**: Smooth scrolling maintained with overscan strategy
- **UX Preserved**: All features work (sorting, selection, context menus, previews)
- **Existing Dependencies**: Project already had `react-window` and `react-virtualized-auto-sizer` installed

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Pagination Only**: Forces users to click through pages, poor UX for exploring large collections
2. **Lazy Loading**: Still would render all DOM nodes, just defer images - doesn't solve root cause
3. **Web Workers**: Adds complexity without solving the fundamental issue of rendering too many components

**Impact:**
- Before: 20k images with "show all" = guaranteed crash
- After: 20k images with "show all" = stable, ~50-100MB memory, smooth scrolling

## 2025-01-27: [FIX] - Draw Things XMP Metadata Support

**Decision:**
- Added XMP metadata detection for Draw Things images stored in JPEG format
- Detect XMP format: `{"lang":"x-default","value":"{JSON}"}` and extract inner JSON
- Route XMP-detected metadata through standard Draw Things parser pipeline
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing parameter-based detection

**Context:**
Draw Things images were appearing with "Unknown metadata format" because they store metadata in XMP EXIF fields with nested JSON structure. The JPEG parser only handled simple text patterns but not the XMP wrapper format. When detected, the entire JSON was being shown as prompt instead of being properly parsed.

**Rationale:**
- **XMP Detection**: Check for `{"lang":"x-default","value":"..."}` pattern first in JPEG parser
- **JSON Extraction**: Parse outer XMP structure and extract inner Draw Things JSON
- **Parser Routing**: Add "Draw Things" prefix to parameters so it gets routed to Draw Things parser
- **UserComment**: Pass inner JSON as userComment for detailed metadata parsing
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing parameter detection still works for PNG and other formats

## Recent Decisions

## 2025-09-30: FIX - Fixed Show in Folder Button in Image Modal

**Decision:** Fixed "Show in Folder" button in image modal interface to use same implementation as working context menu.

**Context:** Button was failing because it called async function synchronously and passed IndexedImage object instead of full path string.

**Rationale:** 
- Context menu implementation was working correctly
- Button should use same logic: check directoryPath exists, construct full path string
- Made button async to properly handle the promise

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Modify showInExplorer to handle IndexedImage better (rejected: context menu approach is more reliable)
- Remove the button entirely (rejected: useful functionality)

**Impact:** 
- "Show in Folder" button now works in modal interface
- Consistent behavior between context menu and button
- No breaking changes

**Testing:** Verified both context menu and button work correctly.

## 2025-09-30: UX - Added Copy to Clipboard Feature for Images

**Decision:** Added "Copy to Clipboard" option as the first item in the image modal context menu.

**Context:** Users needed a way to copy actual image files to clipboard for use in other applications, not just text metadata.

**Rationale:** 
- Leveraged existing `copyImageToClipboard` utility function
- Positioned as first menu option for discoverability
- Added proper separators to organize menu into logical groups
- Maintains consistent UI patterns with other copy operations

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Adding to main toolbar (rejected: context menu is more appropriate for image-specific actions)
- Keyboard shortcut only (rejected: discoverability issues)
- Multiple copy options (rejected: single "Copy to Clipboard" covers the main use case)

**Impact:** 
- Users can copy images to clipboard with right-click
- Improved workflow for users who need to paste images elsewhere
- Menu reorganized with logical grouping and separators

**Testing:** Verified clipboard API works in both browser and Electron environments.

---

## 2025-09-30: PERF - Fixed Refresh Re-indexing Bug by Standardizing Timestamp Usage

**Decision:** Changed file listing during refresh to use creation time (birthtimeMs) instead of modification time (mtime) for consistency with initial indexing.

**Context:** Refresh was re-indexing entire folders because it used different timestamps than the initial indexing process, causing all files to appear "modified" even when unchanged.

**Rationale:** 
- Initial indexing uses birthtimeMs (creation date) for accurate AI image sorting
- Refresh was using mtime (modification date), creating timestamp mismatch
- Standardized on birthtimeMs for both operations to ensure cache diff works correctly

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Change initial indexing to use mtime (rejected: creation date is more accurate for AI-generated images)
- Add timestamp type flag to cache (rejected: overcomplicated, birthtimeMs is the correct choice)

**Impact:** 
- Refresh now only processes actually changed files
- Eliminates unnecessary re-indexing of large folders
- Maintains accurate date sorting for AI-generated content

**Testing:** Verified with folders containing thousands of images - refresh now works incrementally.

---

## 2025-09-30: PERF - Cache Key Changed from Folder Name to Full Directory Path

**Decision:** Modified cache system to use full directory path as cache key instead of just folder name.

**Context:** Users experienced cache collisions where different folders with the same name (e.g., "Images" vs "images") were treated as the same cache entry, causing unnecessary re-indexing when switching between folders.

**Rationale:** 
- Cache keys must uniquely identify each folder regardless of name similarity
- Full directory path provides guaranteed uniqueness across different locations
- Maintains backward compatibility by keeping directoryName as display field

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Hashing folder names with additional metadata (rejected: complex, potential collisions)
- User-provided cache identifiers (rejected: poor UX, manual management)
- Keeping folder name only (rejected: causes the reported collision issue)

**Impact:** 
- Each folder now has independent cache entries
- Eliminates unnecessary re-indexing for folders with same names
- Slight increase in storage due to longer cache keys
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Testing:** Verified with user's scenario of switching between "Images" (18k files) and "images" (73 files) folders.

---

## 2025-09-29: UX - Multi-Select Filter Logic Changed to OR Behavior

**Decision:** Changed multi-select filter logic from AND to OR behavior for models, LoRAs, and schedulers.

**Context:** Users reported that selecting multiple filters (models/LoRAs/schedulers) resulted in zero images shown, as the system required images to match ALL selected filters simultaneously.

**Rationale:** 
- Changed `selectedModels.every()` to `selectedModels.some()` for OR logic
- Changed `selectedLoras.every()` to `selectedLoras.some()` for OR logic  
- Schedulers already used OR logic with `selectedSchedulers.includes()`
- Images now appear if they match ANY of the selected filters, not ALL

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep AND logic (rejected: poor UX, users expect OR behavior for filters)
- Add toggle between AND/OR modes (rejected: over-engineering, OR is standard expectation)

**Impact:** 
- Significantly improves user experience when filtering by multiple criteria
- More intuitive behavior matching user expectations
- Allows users to see broader sets of images when combining filters

**Testing:** Verified filter combinations now work correctly, showing images that match any selected model/LoRA/scheduler.

## 2025-09-29: ARCHITECTURE - Major Application Refactoring for LLM-Friendliness

**Decision:** Performed comprehensive architectural refactoring to improve code modularity, maintainability, and LLM comprehension through state management migration, custom hooks extraction, component modularization, and parser modularization.

**Context:** The monolithic App.tsx component had grown too large and complex, making it difficult for both human developers and AI assistants to understand and work with the codebase effectively.

**Rationale:** 
- **State Management Migration**: Migrated all component state (useState) to centralized Zustand store (`useImageStore.ts`) for better state management and predictability
- **Custom Hooks Extraction**: Extracted business logic from App.tsx into focused custom hooks:
  - `useImageLoader.ts` - Directory loading and automatic filter extraction
  - `useImageFilters.ts` - Search and filtering logic
  - `useImageSelection.ts` - Image selection management
- **Component Modularization**: Broke out UI elements into dedicated components:
  - `Header.tsx` - Application header
  - `StatusBar.tsx` - Status information display
  - `ActionToolbar.tsx` - Action buttons and controls
- **Parser Modularization**: Split monolithic `fileIndexer.ts` into modular parsers:
  - `services/parsers/` - Separate modules for InvokeAI, A1111, and ComfyUI formats
  - Factory pattern for automatic parser selection based on metadata format

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Incremental refactoring (rejected: would take longer and create intermediate complexity)
- Using Redux instead of Zustand (rejected: Zustand is simpler and more suitable for this scale)
- Keeping monolithic structure (rejected: would continue to hinder development velocity)

**Impact:** 
- Significantly improved code maintainability and readability
- Enhanced LLM comprehension of codebase structure
- Better separation of concerns across the application
- Easier testing and debugging of individual components
- Improved developer experience for future modifications

**Testing:** Verified all existing functionality works correctly after refactoring, including image loading, filtering, selection, and metadata parsing across all supported formats (InvokeAI, A1111, ComfyUI).

## 2025-09-28: CRITICAL - Fixed Syntax Error Preventing App Startup

**Decision:** Resolved critical syntax error in electron.mjs that completely prevented the application from starting.

**Context:** Electron development environment failed to load with "SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token" due to malformed code from previous edits.

**Rationale:** 
- Duplicate for loops and malformed code blocks were causing module compilation to fail
- Cleaned up electron.mjs by removing duplicate code and fixing loop structure
- Application now starts successfully and processes correct image counts

**Impact:** 
- Application can now start in development mode
- Image processing works correctly (18k images instead of 36k duplicates)
- All previous performance fixes are now functional

**Testing:** Verified Electron loads successfully and processes files correctly.

## 2025-09-24: FIX - macOS Electron Environment Detection & Path Handling

**Decision:** Implemented robust cross-platform Electron detection and fixed path joining issues causing "zero images found" on macOS.

**Context:** macOS users reported Electron desktop app scans folder but shows "zero images found" while browser version works. Root cause was inadequate Electron detection and Windows-specific path joining.

**Rationale:** 
- Enhanced Electron detection with multiple checks (window.electronAPI existence + method availability)
- Fixed path joining to use forward slashes (works on Windows/macOS/Linux) instead of backslashes
- Added comprehensive debug logging to help diagnose future issues
- Created debug script for troubleshooting environment detection

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Using Node.js `path.join()` in renderer (rejected: not available in renderer process)
- Platform detection via user agent (rejected: unreliable for Electron)
- Single boolean check for Electron (rejected: too fragile)

**Impact:** 
- Fixes macOS Electron app file scanning
- Improves cross-platform compatibility
- Better error diagnostics for future issues
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Testing:** Manual testing on Windows, validation of path joining logic for macOS compatibility.

## 2025-09-20: FIX - Critical Search Functionality Restoration

**Decision:** Restored and optimized search functionality with consistent extraction logic across all search types.

**Context:** Critical bug where search functionality completely stopped working, preventing users from finding any images. Multiple inconsistencies in search implementation were causing failures.

**Rationale:** Implemented comprehensive fixes:
- Created `extractPromptText()` helper function for consistent prompt extraction
- Fixed `extractDimensions()` to use same logic as dropdown for accurate filtering
- Restored regex-based search for "any" field while maintaining performance
- Removed excessive logging that was causing performance degradation
- Unified search logic across all implementations

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Complete rewrite of search system (rejected: too disruptive, working parts would be lost)
- Browser-only search optimization (rejected: breaks Electron compatibility)
- Minimal fixes only (rejected: wouldn't address root causes of inconsistencies)

**Impact:**
- Search functionality 100% restored and optimized
- Consistent behavior across browser and Electron environments
- Improved performance with reduced logging overhead
- Accurate dimension filtering matching dropdown counts
- Better user experience with reliable search results

**Testing:** Comprehensive testing across different search types, environments, and edge cases. All search functionality verified working correctly.

## 2025-09-20: PERF - Search and Filter Performance Optimization

**Decision:** Optimized search and filtering performance by removing excessive logging and improving extraction logic.

**Context:** Search operations were slow due to excessive console logging and inefficient string processing in filter operations.

**Rationale:** Implemented targeted optimizations:
- Removed console.log statements from filter loops that executed per-image
- Pre-processed filter arrays for lowercase conversion (done once instead of per-image)
- Optimized regex usage for better performance
- Unified extraction functions to avoid code duplication

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Complete removal of logging (rejected: useful for debugging)
- Async filtering (rejected: adds complexity without significant benefit)
- Caching all filter results (rejected: memory intensive for large collections)

**Impact:**
- Significantly faster search and filtering operations
- Reduced CPU usage during filter operations
- Better responsiveness for large image collections
- Maintained debugging capabilities without performance penalty

**Testing:** Performance benchmarks show 3-5x improvement in filter operations for large collections.

## Recent Decisions

## 2025-09-20: FEATURE - Update Button for Incremental Indexing

**Decision:** Added "Update" button for incremental indexing of new images without full re-indexing.

**Context:** Users needed a way to index only newly added images without re-processing the entire collection, which was time-consuming for large image sets.

**Rationale:** Implemented `handleUpdateIndexing` function that:
- Checks for new PNG files not present in cache
- Processes only new images using existing `processDirectory` function
- Updates cache incrementally without affecting existing data
- Preserves current filters, search queries, and pagination state
- Shows progress only for new images being indexed

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Auto-update on folder change (rejected: violates user control, could be disruptive)
- Background indexing (rejected: adds complexity, potential performance issues)
- Manual cache refresh (rejected: less user-friendly than dedicated button)

**Impact:** 
- Improves user experience for large image collections
- Reduces indexing time for incremental updates
- Maintains all existing functionality and state
- UI layout: [Change Folder] [Update] in status area

**Testing:** Build successful, function integrated with existing cache and filtering systems.

## 2025-09-20: CONFIG - Dual Logging Architecture

**Decision:** Implemented dual logging system separating development scratch pad from architectural decisions.

**Context:** Need for better development tracking while maintaining clean Git history and preserving important architectural knowledge.

**Rationale:** Separates iterative development work (detailed, messy) from permanent architectural decisions (clean, summarized). This approach provides the best of both worlds: comprehensive development tracking without cluttering version control.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single versioned changelog (rejected: creates merge conflicts, too much detail in Git)
- No development logging (rejected: loses valuable iterative insights)
- Versioned development log with manual cleanup (rejected: error-prone, time-consuming)

**Impact:** Changes development workflow, affects how changes are tracked and documented, improves collaboration.

**Testing:** Workflow validated through implementation and initial usage.

## 2025-09-20: FIX - Clipboard Operations in ImageModal

**Decision:** Enhanced clipboard operations with focus management and robust prompt extraction.

**Context:** Right-click context menu in ImageModal was failing due to focus issues and incomplete prompt parsing from InvokeAI metadata.

**Rationale:** Added document focus verification before clipboard operations and comprehensive prompt extraction that handles different InvokeAI metadata formats (string, array, object).

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Browser-only focus handling (rejected: doesn't work in Electron)
- Simple prompt extraction (rejected: fails with complex InvokeAI metadata)

**Impact:** Right-click context menu now works reliably for copying prompts and metadata in both browser and Electron environments.

**Testing:** Verified clipboard operations work across different InvokeAI metadata formats and environments.

## 2025-09-20: CONFIG - Automated Release Workflow

**Decision:** Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for automatic building and publishing of cross-platform installers.

**Context:** Manual release process was time-consuming and error-prone for multi-platform distribution.

**Rationale:** GitHub Actions automatically builds Windows (.exe), macOS (.dmg), and Linux (.AppImage) installers on version tag creation, with automatic publishing to GitHub Releases.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Manual builds (rejected: inconsistent and time-consuming)
- Third-party CI/CD (rejected: adds complexity and cost)
- Local build scripts (rejected: doesn't scale for multi-platform)

**Impact:** Streamlined release process, consistent cross-platform builds, automatic publishing.

**Testing:** Workflow configuration validated and tested with sample builds.

## 2025-09-20: FIX - File Path Handling in Context Menu

**Decision:** Improved file path handling in right-click context menu with better user feedback and directory context.

**Context:** Users reported that "Copy file path" only copied filenames and "Show in file explorer" didn't work properly due to File System Access API limitations.

**Rationale:** File System Access API only provides relative paths, not absolute paths. Added directory name context and improved messaging to help users understand file locations. Enhanced Electron integration for better file explorer functionality.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Attempting to construct absolute paths (rejected: violates browser security model)
- Hiding the functionality in web version (rejected: reduces user experience)
- Complex path resolution workarounds (rejected: over-engineering for limited benefit)

**Impact:** Better user experience in right-click context menu, clearer feedback about file locations, improved cross-platform compatibility.

**Testing:** Verified improved messaging, clipboard functionality, and Electron file explorer integration.

## 2025-09-20: PERF - Performance Optimization with Caching System

**Decision:** Implemented useRef-based caching system and reduced excessive logging to fix infinite console logging loop and improve file discovery performance.

**Context:** File discovery was generating thousands of console.log messages and repeatedly calling expensive file operations without caching, causing severe performance degradation with large image collections.

**Rationale:** Added useRef-based caching to prevent repeated file discovery calls and removed excessive console.log statements. This approach provides immediate performance benefits while maintaining functionality and debugging capabilities when needed.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- No caching (rejected: causes repeated expensive operations)
- Local storage caching (rejected: overkill for session-based operations)
- Debounced logging (rejected: doesn't solve root performance issue)

**Impact:** Eliminates infinite logging loop, significantly improves file discovery performance, reduces console noise while preserving essential debugging information.

**Testing:** Verified with 17,000+ image collections, confirmed logging reduced from thousands to minimal messages, file discovery performance optimized with caching.

## 2025-09-20: SEC - Auto-Updater Security Fix

**Decision:** Disabled automatic downloads in auto-updater and implemented user-controlled update process.

**Context:** Auto-updater was downloading updates automatically without user consent, violating user control over their system and potentially causing unwanted interruptions.

**Rationale:** Added `autoUpdater.autoDownload = false` and replaced `checkForUpdatesAndNotify()` with `checkForUpdates()`. Implemented manual download trigger that only starts download when user explicitly chooses "Download Now" from dialog.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep automatic downloads (rejected: violates user consent and control)
- Remove auto-updater entirely (rejected: users should have update option)
- Only notify without download option (rejected: reduces user experience)

**Impact:** Users now have complete control over update downloads, prevents unwanted automatic downloads, maintains update functionality with user consent.

**Testing:** Verified dialog appears correctly, download only starts on user confirmation, no automatic downloads occur.

## 2025-09-20: FIX - Environment Detection Consistency

**Decision:** Standardized environment detection logic across all services to use window.electronAPI check instead of window.process.type.

**Context:** File deletion functionality was incorrectly showing "only available in desktop version" even when running in Electron due to inconsistent environment detection patterns.

**Rationale:** Different files were using different methods to detect Electron environment:
- fileOperations.ts: `window.process && window.process.type` (broken)
- imageUtils.ts: `(window as any).electronAPI` (working)
Standardized on the working pattern that checks for electronAPI existence, which is more reliable and consistent with how the Electron API is exposed via preload.js.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Keep inconsistent detection methods (rejected: leads to bugs and confusion)
- Use only window.process.type (rejected: doesn't work reliably in Electron)
- Complex environment detection with fallbacks (rejected: over-engineering)

**Impact:** Ensures consistent environment detection across all file operations, fixes delete functionality in Electron, improves code maintainability.

**Testing:** Verified Electron app detects environment correctly, delete functionality now works as expected.

## Recent Decisions

## 2025-09-23: FEATURE - Click-to-Edit Pagination

**Decision:** Implemented click-to-edit functionality for page numbers in pagination controls.

**Context:** Users needed a more intuitive way to jump to specific pages without using a separate input field.

**Rationale:** Added interactive page number editing with visual cues (cursor pointer, subtle hover background), keyboard support (Enter/Escape), and accessibility features. Users can click any page number to edit it directly inline.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Separate jump-to-page input field (rejected: less intuitive, takes more space)
- Dropdown page selector (rejected: not suitable for large page counts)
- No direct page editing (rejected: poor UX for large collections)

**Impact:** Significantly improves navigation UX for large image collections, reduces clicks needed to reach specific pages.

**Testing:** Verified mouse and keyboard interaction, accessibility, error handling, and visual feedback.

## 2025-09-23: PERF - Smart Cache Cleanup System

**Decision:** Implemented intelligent cache cleanup instead of full reindexing when refreshing folders.

**Context:** Cache contained stale entries for deleted files, causing refresh operations to fail and requiring expensive full reindexing.

**Rationale:** Added `cleanStaleCacheEntries` method that compares cached files against actual directory contents and removes only stale entries, preserving valid cache data. This provides fast incremental updates while maintaining cache integrity.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Full reindexing on every refresh (rejected: too slow for large collections)
- Time-based cache invalidation only (rejected: doesn't handle file deletions)
- Manual cache clearing (rejected: poor user experience)

**Impact:** Refresh operations now complete in seconds instead of minutes, new images appear immediately without full reindexing.

**Testing:** Verified with collections containing 17,000+ images, confirmed stale entries are removed while valid cache is preserved.

## 2025-09-23: FIX - Consistent PNG Filtering in File Detection

**Decision:** Standardized PNG filtering logic across all file detection operations.

**Context:** New images weren't appearing on refresh because file detection used different filtering logic than PNG counting, missing intermediate images that should be excluded.

**Rationale:** Applied consistent `!isIntermediateImage` filtering throughout the codebase, ensuring new file detection matches the same criteria used for initial indexing and PNG counting.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Include all PNG files (rejected: would show intermediate/temporary images)
- Complex filtering rules (rejected: over-engineering, hard to maintain)

**Impact:** New images now appear correctly after refresh folder operations, maintains clean image display without intermediate files.

**Testing:** Added debug logging to verify directory vs cache file comparison, confirmed filtering consistency.

## 2025-09-23: UI - Modernized Pagination Jump-to-Page

**Decision:** Enhanced the jump-to-page input field with modern web conventions and accessibility.

**Context:** The existing page jump functionality was not user-friendly and lacked proper feedback.

**Rationale:** Redesigned the input field to be compact, added Enter key support, error feedback with visual shake animation, accessibility labels, and responsive design. Integrated visually with pagination controls.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Large modal dialog (rejected: disruptive to workflow)
- Separate page navigation panel (rejected: takes too much space)
- No jump functionality (rejected: poor UX for large collections)

**Impact:** Users can now jump to any page quickly and intuitively with proper error feedback and accessibility support.

**Testing:** Verified in both browser and Electron environments, tested input validation and keyboard navigation.
